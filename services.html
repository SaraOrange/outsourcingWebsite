                                Customer acquisition has been proven to cost 4 to 10 times more than retaining an existing customer. 
                                You have the clients, now you have to keep them. With the right customer care, word of mouth alone can contribute to an increase in customers by 50%.
                                Our current partners have experienced 100% client retention. We ensure every customer is treated as an individual with a personalized experience, 
                                we don’t believe in a robotic system.
                                We ensure your customers are not waiting to talk to a machine, but passed straight through to a well informed, 
                                understanding, well spoken, multilingual employee.

                                Technical support and services directly represent your company’s image. 
                                Having the right technical support is crucial to maintain positive brand loyalty. 
                                Negative technical support is the fundamental cause for customer loss. 
                                We take several measures to ensure your customers receive the best possible technical support starting with our tele executives. 
                                Our telesupport staff have confidence when presented with problems, and are well informed and sympathetic towards the customer. 
                                All staff are trained to take a step by step approach when tackling problems. 
                                Our tele executives are dedicated to your campaign and once assigned do not move departments, 
                                which ensures they understand and are up to speed on how to tackle problems specific to your campaign.

                            During this time they learn how to sell to clients with non-aggressive sales techniques while still
